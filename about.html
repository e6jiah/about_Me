		<h3>A short summary of my life until recent times</h3>
		<p>Hello, my name is Ilya (that's the original name which I got in my birth certification, it is pronounced with a stress on the second syllable), a name by passport - Ilja, 
		my government has changed it to follow Latvian way of writing and pronunciation. I have been born in Ventspils, Latvia at the following date: 02 March 1991. Currently, I am 28 years old, 
		while being judged like a teenager by new people I encounter (possibly the number of teacups I have taken over my life, made an impact at my young appearance).</p>
		<p>I have been raised by grandparents. Both of them were former engineering specialists, they have met each other during USSR times during their work at some hidden by government factory which 
		were focused around rockets and aircraft production. They have received the job offers with the possibility to relocate to the city where I have grown at, which they could not reject, as it was a 
		wonderful place with opportunities in careers back then and now for families at the coast of Baltic sea. They have born 2 daughters, and that is how I have been born a bit later by one of their daughters. 
		My mother was too young at the time I was growing up and my grandparents took responsibility for me.</p>
		<p>There is not much interesting to tell about my secondary school times aside from the only subject that I was loving was mathematics. Back then I even was invited multiple times to local maths olympiads 
		for scholars, where multiple times I have received second place (the first place were taken by local chess genius, so I am a bit proud for that second place I was reaching).</p>
		<p>Being at the age of 15 I have changed my secondary school to vocational school which was a mix of secondary school and qualification studies (welding and metalworks). 
		The main reason for that change - that back then, welders were earning good amounts of money in Latvia and as I was living with grandparents sharing their pension, 
		I wanted to have my own money as soon as possible, and that was the possibility for it. (normally, people over there finishing secondary schools at the age of 18 and going for further education 
		which takes around 3-4 years more)</p>
		<p>On the completion of vocational school, I did not want to work as a welder and spent approximately a year or two without any jobs done. At the age of 19, 
		I have been offered a non-qualified job in the United Kingdom. I have been worked over there for a fair amount of time, 6 days a week earning money with no goals for my life. 
		Until I started to meet people who were inviting me to other parts of the country for different jobs. So generally speaking I was living 4-5 years in the UK traveling and trying to find 
		the place for myself among non-qualified jobs, where I can bring some value and maintain a good balance between life and work for happiness. During those years I met a lot of people with different backgrounds 
		and in my opinion got learned the life and understanding of life values.</p>
		<p>The last city I ended up in the UK was Peterborough, I have found a company of good people with whom I was enjoying spending my time together and at the same time, 
		there was a lot of work available, where I was able to earn some income for my life. Until I got the call back from home with sad news about my grandmother - she was dying and I've been asked to return 
		to take care of her. Shortly after my arrival, grandmother passed away and I was trying to establish myself over there, as she has left multiple properties for me. But, I couldn't live there anymore as 
		I was already used to life in the UK among different cultures with multiple times the better quality of life than at my homeland.</p>
		<p>With such a loss for me, as grandmother was the closest person to me in my life and supported me through my life in the UK - I didn't exactly know what I should do next. 
		I decided to ask my mother (who were living in Ireland for around 10 years already) if she don't mind helping me to leave Latvia and try establish myself in Ireland, as she is the last family member 
		I have left with and I was in doubt about going back to the UK as I wanted to grow and seek for something new for my soul (in other words - I was trying to start my life from the "blank page").</p>
		<p>On my arrival in Ireland, I had to find a job as soon as possible within the location of where my mother was living, and I have been applying for everything possible where no experience was required. 
		I got a job offer as a kitchen porter at a hotel in the nearby town, which I happily accepted as I didn't want to live with my mother (not used to live with her). I have spent a couple of months there 
		until I lost the job, the reason for that was - "We had a guy working before you, he broke his arm... You were just a temporary replacement..".</p>
		<p>Luckily my mother knew that it is possible to sign in for education in Ireland as a mature student. And she offered me to start educating myself for a chance of getting the job I will like to do. 
		I decided to go to Engineering as my grandparents were and I had some knowledge already about this course. So it would be easier for me to learn as at that time my English was at poor level 
		(reason - all people who I have been with around in the UK were foreigners with low level of English, mainly I was using Russian there without needs of learning English, every agency had Russian 
		speaking people from Baltic countries who were assisting people with setting up for the jobs around). Shortly after spending 1 year at plc course I started 
		computer science studies, that is written in the intro page.. :)</p>
