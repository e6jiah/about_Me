		<h3>The goal I aim to with this website</h3>
		<p id="warning">As my native language is Russian, I apologize straight away for any mistakes made within texts I have written here and hopefully, you will figure out my way of making sentences, thank you.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this website is to introduce myself to people who I brought here by including my website into the CV in a non-formal format (written without any templates and standards).
		As I don't really enjoy making CV's "professionally looking" with tons of fake information provided there just to grab an attention of employers and getting the chance for interview
		(like most of people do, in particular - recent college graduates) by showing/highlighting their skill set, which is usually above the reality.</p>
		
		<h3>My experience in Computing and reasons for choice of web development</h3>
		<p>My experience with computing science started in September 2015, when I joined the Software Development course within the Institute of Technology, Tralee. 
		Same year's spring I was about to finish PLC course in Engineering Technology, where one of the teachers made a recommendation to me to join Computing as she has seen my abilities 
		of quickly learning and memorizing usage of the software that I had never used before. After doing some research about courses available within Institution, and job opportunities promised 
		by the completion of the courses available - I have decided to join Software Development, as I got lightened by bullet points with jobs where is practical logic involved (programming).</p>
		<p>During my studying at Institution, I was supposed to learn all aspects of software development phases. Ranging from a knowledge of how to build internet networks to designing 
		boring software using waterfall model approach and test packages for it (boring, because everyone had same requirements to follow, what was limiting us in creativity).</p>
		<p>Generally speaking, through first 3 stages (bachelor degree) of the course I have been doing, my favorite modules were those where programming was involved - such as Java, C#, HTML/CSS/PHP, 
		shell scripting and creation of queries for databases. While I was suffering learning theories from other areas of computing for "copy/pasting" it into exam papers without a precise understanding 
		of how everything works together and why do we need that.</p>
		<p>I have reached stage 4 (honours), where I was supposed to research random information from publicly available academical sources related to trending computing areas, such as - Artificial Intelligence, 
		Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and others... And finding out the project I want to do as my FYP, I have come up with a couple of ideas I thought I will have interest in implementing, and which might 
		have the potential of being useful to people later on. Those project ideas were rejected as mentors were looking for datasets being used in it and as I understood they were looking for a theoretical 
		implementation of a project in the FYP book, while my ideas were supposed to deliver assistance to people and had more practical side, my last idea was delivering a chat-bot focused at dietology. 
		After unsuccessful attempts in finding project idea, I decided that it is time leave Institution, as I was feeling like it is a dead end for me and this year will give me nothing on completion 
		(aside from honours degree) without interest in doing a theoretical project about something I have no interest in. I have officially stopped my studies and has been withdrawn from the course on the 
		last day of January straight after Christmas break.</p>
		<p>During Christmas time I was thinking about what I should do and where my interests land, and came up with focusing into web development as that was the best subjects for me during my studies 
		with highest grades, comparing to other subjects as I was able to see result after each line of code written which was making me inspired on keeping work. And the other reason for it - that it is 
		very common for web developers to work remotely on projects and that what my goals are for the late future (I got dreams about having a sailboat, and having a possibility to earn resources remotely). 
		I don't think I have talents for design, but I definitely have abilities at quickly doing the tasks given by designers and others by programming requested features. I don't know how, as my, English is 
		not so fluent as I would like it to be, but I am intuitively good at searching for solutions using StackOverflow, documentation and google in general.</p>
		<p>After sorting out my life, in particular - the source of income, while I will be searching for a job. I have started to research web development books as a reminder for what I have been learning in the 
		institute (have covered HTML + CSS + JavaScript website development books written by Jon Duckett). Straight after that, I have slowly started to practice things, and uploading them to my GitHub repository 
		(slowly - because I am living in the house with no proper noise isolation made, where repair jobs going on, hard for me to concentrate on things I am doing while being surrounded by noisy environment).</p>
		<p>Hopefully, everything I have written so far over here makes some sense about my abilities and shows my intent. Thank you!</p>
