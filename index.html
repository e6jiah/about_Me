		<h3>The goal I aim to with this website</h3>
		<p id="warning">As my native language is Russian, I apologize straight away for any mistakes made within texts I have written here and hopefully you will figure out my way of making sentences, thank you.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this website is to introduce myself to people who I brought here by including my website into CV in a non formal format (written without any templates and standarts). 
		As I don't really enjoy making CV's "professionaly looking" with tons of fake information provided there just to grab an attention of employers and getting the chance for interview (like most of people do,
		in particular - recent college graduates) by showing/highlighting their skill set, which is usually above the reality.</p>
		
		<h3>Why web development?</h3>
		<p>My experience with computing science started in September 2015, when I joined Software Development course within Institute of Technology, Tralee. Same year's spring I was about to finish PLC course
		in Engineering Technology, where one of teachers made recommendation to me to join Computing as she have seen my abilities of quickly learning and memorising usage of software that I had never used before.
		After doing some research about courses available within Institution, and job opportunities promised by completion of the courses available - I have decided to join Software Development, as I got lightened
		by bullet points with jobs where is practical logic involved (programming).</p>
		<p>During my studying in Institution, I was supposed to learn all aspects of software development phases. Ranging from knowledge of how to build internet networks to designing boring software using waterfall model
		approach and test packages for it (boring, because everyone had same requirements to follow, what was limiting us in creativity).</p>
		<p>Generally speaking, through first 3 stages (bachelor degree) of the course I have been doing, my favourite modules were those where programming was involved - such as Java, C#, HTML/CSS/PHP
		, shell scripting and creation of queries for databases.. While I was suffering learning theories from other areas of computing for "copy/pasting" it into exam papers
		without precise understanding of how everything works together and why do we need that.</p>
		<p>I have reached stage 4 (honours), where I was supposed to research random information from publicly available academical sources related to trending computing areas, such as -
		Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and others.. And finding out the project I want to do as my FYP, i have came up with couple of ideas i thought I will have interest in implementing, 
		and which might have potential of being usefull to people later on. Those project ideas were rejected as mentors were looking for datasets being used in it and as I understood they were looking 
		for theoretical implementation of project in the FYP book, while my ideas were supposed to deliver assistance to people and had more practical side, my last idea was delivering an chat-bot focused at dietology. 
		After unsuccessful attempts I decided that it is time leave Institution, as I was feeling like it is dead end for me and this year will give me nothing on completion (aside from honours degree) 
		without interest in doing theoretical project. I have officialy stopped my studies and has been withdrawn from course at the last day of January straight after Christmas break.</p>
		<p>During Christmas time I was thinking about what I should do and where my interests land, and came up with focusing into web development as that was the best subjects for me during my studies with 
		highest grades, comparing to other subjects as I was able to see result after each line of code written which was making me inspired on keeping work. 
		And the other reason for it - that it is very common for web developers to work remotely on projects and that what my goals are for the late future (I got dreams about having a sailboat, and having possibility 
		to earn resources remotely). I don't think I have talents for design, but I definetely have abilities at quickly doing the tasks given by designers and others by programming requested features. 
		I don't know how, as my English is not so fluent as I would like it to be, but I am intuitively good at searching for solutions using stackoverflow, documentations and google in general.</p>
