		<h3>My course of life outside of Computing</h3>
		<p>Hello, my name is Ilya (thats the original name which I got in my birth certification, it is pronounced with stress on the second syllable), name by passport - Ilja, my government has changed it to follow
		Latvian way of writing and pronunciation. I have been born in Ventspils, Latvia at the following date: 02 March 1991. Currently I am 28 years old, while being judged like a teenager by new people I encounter
		(possibly the amount of tea cups I have taken over my life, made an inpact at my young appearance).</p>
